## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ :pray: 
Iâ€™m <b>[Binu Kumar](www.binu.live)</b>. I am a <b>Full Stack Developer</b> from India :india:.

I am currently in my <b>3rd year</b> studying <b>B.E.</b> in 
<b>Computer Science :computer: </b> at <b>[JSS Science and Technology University](https://jssstuniv.in/)</b>,
Mysore, karnataka, India and also <b>Web Developer Lead</b> at
<b>[Developer Student Clubs, JSSSTU](https://dscjssstu.netlify.app/)</b>. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that
matter.

I like to prefer myself surround with people who are focused on
execution :dart:, hardworking and always ready to help others in need. For me
helping society, fulfilling my parents dreams, being honest, fair and
friendly with everyone is my everything.
